## Description
Data and script to analyze the local co-occurrence patterns of ariids in the Amazonian estuary. These results are discussed in the manuscript "Environmental conditions promote local segregation of catfishes in the Amazonian estuary, but ecomorphological differences may allow aggregation", in preparation.

## How to use this directory
In R, you may download all the data contained in this repository by using the download.file() function, then use the function unzip(). Example:

`
download.file(url="https://github.com/bruno-soares/MS_Ariid_Cooccurrence/archive/master.zip", destfile = "MS_Ariid_Cooccurrence.zip")
unzip(zipfile = "MS_Ariid_Cooccurrence.zip")
`

R scripts are numbered in the order that the analyses are performed, from 01 to 06. All the data necessary to run analyses are availagle in /data and /results, so one can run any part of the script independently from running prior analysis. Make sure you install the necessary R packages before running the analysis.
